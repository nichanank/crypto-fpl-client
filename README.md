## ‚öΩÔ∏è CryptoFPL Client

Interacts with the CryptoFPLCards and CryptoFPL smart contracts.

## Requirements
To create the `src/contracts` folder containing the abi and address of the CryptoFPL contracts, this repository should be cloned while you're in the crypto-fpl folder (repo can be found [here](https://github.com/nichanank/crypto-fpl)). From that folder, run `truffle migrate --reset` will create the contracts folder in the `src/contracts `. See the README file of the CryptoFPL repo for full documentation. 

üéÆ Run the client using `npm run start` and navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser
